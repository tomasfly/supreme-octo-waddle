   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-node-postgres-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd my-node-postgres-app

   ```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database:

   - Update the database configuration in `src/db.js` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will start a server listening on port 8000.

## Docker

To run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-postgres-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 my-node-postgres-app
   ```

   The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

## Kubernetes

To deploy the application to Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up.

2. Apply the deployment configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

3. Apply the service configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
   ```

4. Access the load balancer:

   ```bash
   kubectl get service my-node-postgres-app-service
   ```

   The load balancer's external IP will be displayed. Access the application using that IP.
